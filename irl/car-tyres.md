Alright, you wanna learn how to change a mfin' car tire?

1. Use a car jack to lift your car slightly off the ground, so that its not touching
2. Remove the bolts
    - If using a crosskey, try gripping it like a mixed grip, with one hand pulling up and one pushing down
3. Punch/kick it, so that it falls off
    - If a light punch/kick fails, try multiple hard ones
4. Move the marker of which tire you're replacing to the new one (so that you can replace the same tire next year)
    - After 3-4 years, it might be a good idea to put the back tires in the front, as those get run down more quickly
5. Place the tire, so that the holes on the axle are visible
6. Screw in the bolts, just using your hands, starting with the bottom and top holes, and taking the rest after
7. Screw them in quite alot more, until the wheel starts turning with the bolts
8. Let the car from the car jack
9. Tighten the bolts until you cannot tighten anymore
10. Repeat.

hell yeah.
